## Hello, I'm Marianne ðŸŒ±

I'm a Sr. Project Manager with 10 years of career capital, currently building the skills I'll need to transition to work in AI/LLM tech.

Right now I'm most excited about building agents and LLM systems with MCP tools that help me do stuff I wanna do and make stuff I wanna make.

I'm slowly building up my portfolio of projects: here is <a href="https://www.whichtechstack.com">Which Tech Stack?</a>, my first attempt at building a web app using nothing but AI coding assistance. I built this quiz because I was unclear about which stacks to use for different kinds of projects. Turns out someone else was already building something like this, so here it gets filed as "portfolio project."

While I'm still learning, I'm mostly finding ways to use Python and other scripting languages and frameworks to solve my own problems.
