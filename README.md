## Hello, I'm Marianne ðŸŒ±

I'm a Sr. Project Manager with 10 years of career capital, currently building the skills I'll need to transition to tech.

I'm an AI/LLM coding enthusiast and right now I'm most excited about building agentic AI systems with MCP tools. 

I'm slowly building up my portfolio of projects: here is <a href="https://www.whichtechstack.com">Which Tech Stack?</a>, my first attempt at building a web app using AI coding assistants. I built this quiz because I was unclear about which stacks to use for different kinds of projects. Let me know if you find it useful!

While learning, I'm mostly finding ways to use Python and other scripting languages and frameworks to solve my own problems.

You can connect with me on <a href = "https://x.com/thrialectic">Twitter</a> if you're open to inane ramblings, or you can contact me at ðŸ“« thrialectics at gmail dot com.
